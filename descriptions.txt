Koch:Teaches well and is overall pretty laid back. Doesn’t care about what you do as long as it’s not stupid. 8.5/10
Koch:I have beef with her because of an incident. Won’t deny that she is a good teacher though, and is in the middle of the grading harshness scale. 7/10
Koch:Pretty good teacher especially for late in the day, I’ve never seen her mad at anyone and she’s super chill. Grades ICTW’s kinda rough, but I guess that’s making us better(?) 9/10

Nichols:She gets off topic sometimes, but her grades are somewhat strict but fair, and is really chill. 8/10
Nichols:A good mix of tough grading and good teaching, she’s chill but will prepare you for next year. Honestly my favorite class of the day. She acts like a chill senior. As far as ICTW grading goes, she is probably 1-2 points higher than Gerik, and like 7-8 lower than Koch. She also will make you put phones up. - Side note, she did falsely accuse me of using AI, but that was a systematic check and she actually didn’t pursue it further, despite the district guidelines. 10/10

Nichols:Very chill i don't think she yelled at my class in the entire year, better than most teachers at teaching harder at grading tho,makes you play vocab game. 7/10 
Nichols:Classical white teacher who believes that an 80 is a good grade. If it is for you then ur going to do great. Otherwise, you’ll find that your other grades will be pulling your average down. I’ve never seen her give a hundred yet but I feel like she grades rather fairly, if strictly.
Gerik:Pretty laid back, will tell you to get off your phone though. Good at instructing and reading, pretty nice and I haven’t seen her get mad yet. She’s harsh at grading and takes pretty long to put in grades, especially ICTWs. 7/10
Gerik: I didn’t have the greatest time in her class (she hates me), she grades ictw’s wayyyy too harsh, and she wakes you up if you sleep in class :/ 4/10 — [side note from someone else, I was sleeping right in front of her in the front row WHILE she was teaching and she didn’t even bother on waking me up]

Gerik:She's pretty laid back and is good for both introverts and extroverts, grades pretty harshly but will set you up for the future so I guess that's a plus. I do find her pretty boring and she won't let you put your head down T-T Monkey/ 10
Gerik:She’s a great teacher and can teach well. Grades harshly but fairly. Idk what yall are talking about when you say she tells you to keep your head up, she lets me lie my head down often as long as i do my work. 8.5/10
