Koch:Teaches well and is overall pretty laid back. Doesn’t care about what you do as long as it’s not stupid. 8.5/10
Koch:I have beef with her because of an incident. Won’t deny that she is a good teacher though, and is in the middle of the grading harshness scale. 7/10
Koch:Pretty good teacher especially for late in the day, I’ve never seen her mad at anyone and she’s super chill. Grades ICTW’s kinda rough, but I guess that’s making us better(?) 9/10

Nichols:She gets off topic sometimes, but her grades are somewhat strict but fair, and is really chill. 8/10
Nichols:A good mix of tough grading and good teaching, she’s chill but will prepare you for next year. Honestly my favorite class of the day. She acts like a chill senior. As far as ICTW grading goes, she is probably 1-2 points higher than Gerik, and like 7-8 lower than Koch. She also will make you put phones up. - Side note, she did falsely accuse me of using AI, but that was a systematic check and she actually didn’t pursue it further, despite the district guidelines. 10/10

Nichols:Very chill i don't think she yelled at my class in the entire year, better than most teachers at teaching harder at grading tho,makes you play vocab game. 7/10 
Nichols:Classical white teacher who believes that an 80 is a good grade. If it is for you then ur going to do great. Otherwise, you’ll find that your other grades will be pulling your average down. I’ve never seen her give a hundred yet but I feel like she grades rather fairly, if strictly.
Gerik:Pretty laid back, will tell you to get off your phone though. Good at instructing and reading, pretty nice and I haven’t seen her get mad yet. She’s harsh at grading and takes pretty long to put in grades, especially ICTWs. 7/10
Gerik: I didn’t have the greatest time in her class (she hates me), she grades ictw’s wayyyy too harsh, and she wakes you up if you sleep in class :/ 4/10 — [side note from someone else, I was sleeping right in front of her in the front row WHILE she was teaching and she didn’t even bother on waking me up]

Gerik:She's pretty laid back and is good for both introverts and extroverts, grades pretty harshly but will set you up for the future so I guess that's a plus. I do find her pretty boring and she won't let you put your head down T-T Monkey/ 10
Gerik:She’s a great teacher and can teach well. Grades harshly but fairly. Idk what yall are talking about when you say she tells you to keep your head up, she lets me lie my head down often as long as i do my work. 8.5/10
Gerik:she’s pretty laidback and chill as a person, however her grading on the ICTWs is rather… questionable. She takes longer than usual (as in 5 of the six weeks of each grading cycle) to release grades, which are also considerably low as she’s a lot more strict with grading. It’s annoying, but I won’t complain too much because it helps with the AP exam. She also will wake you up in class if you fall asleep and she doesn’t like phones. Overall though she can teach fairly well and she isn’t bad at all, 6.5/10
Gerik:she’s not that bad just really harsh on ictw and phone use, 7/10
Gerik:She is rly laid back and generally nice and very chill. But I dont like her teaching styles. Go to other teachers’ tutorials (Nichols) if you ac wanna learn and get good grades. She grades ICTWs like its AP lang, so unless you absolutely cook, expect a high 70 to a low 80 at best for the avg ICTW. Also can be rly dry at times. PROCRASTINATES GRADING UNTIL THE LAST SECOND OF THE LAST MINTUE OF THE SIX WEEKS, YOULL GET YOUR FALL ICTW GRADES AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS.(5.75/10)

Gerik:shes tough grader but shes chill person and u can talk to her 7/10
Gerik:had a hard time in english 1 cuz of her it’s easy to get a B but not to get an A (5.5/10)
Gerik: I’m pretty sure she didn’t even post the ICTW grades for a six weeks at one point bc she didn’t finish. I’m also kind of certain she gave everyone a 100 in the second semester ictw part of the final exam, bc I got a full marks on it(I’m just better) 4/10
Gerik: 6/10 she's nice to you if you stay on task and not be too noisy, but grades insanely late. I had an A so it's achievable but you have to cook with your analysis. The grading isn't as bad after experiencing English 2, but you don't learn anything in her ictw teachings. Was decently nice until the end of the year where she was super unsympathetic to someone who called in about a kid who had to leave because they had an anxiety attack while presenting and just said “well they're gonna have to at some point”.
Gerik:She’s rly nice and would def help you but her grading is so slow. Everyone whos had her will tell you it takes forever for her to put grades in. ik people complain abt her grading hard but its honestly doable you can def get an a 7/10
Farris:very nice, also a good teacher and a fair grader. Good at helping prepare her students for tests and quizzes while also making English, a heinous subject, somewhat enjoyable and doable for her students. 10/10 
Farris: I mean what do I put other than 10/10? She always helps you, and she literally gives you an overview of tests and quizzes of e.g. how many questions, what types, what the test/assignment would be over, etc. 10/10 I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad english teacher in my life.
Farris:Good teacher, grades too easy imo even if its normal grading by this schools standards its not really harsh enough. 9/10
Farris:My favorite teacher in 9th grade, was chill about the phones until almost no one was putting it up and made us put them up. The phone thing was the only thing she was kinda strict about. Super nice and you can talk to her like your friend and tell her about your day. She’ll even listen if you rant about somethingin school like a bad teacher or something. One day i was feeling down and she asked if i was ok. Best teacher. 10/10
Farris:Fav teacher in 9th grade too, really nice person.
Farris:9/10, really nice teacher, but her grading honestly made me suffer sophomore year. She does however grade more strictly towards the end of the year but not to the scale of english 2 teachers. 
Garcia:For an ACA teacher, she really cares way too much about what we’re doing in class. FIncidents have happened that show she discriminates unfairly against former KAP/GT kids. She also gets on people way too much for sleeping in class, but at least she doesn’t grade super hard. 2/10
Garcia:Picked on black people and glazed me
